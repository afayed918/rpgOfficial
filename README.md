RPG-40 Assignment From CSCI-40

Jacob Deel -> World Map Person
Moyinoluwa Oyinleye -> puzzle
Adam -> combat

1.) we used variables to store the user input
2.) we used algebra to randomize the map, so that the user gets an array of different maps
3.) we used input and output to get the user's username and then display the username when the user enters the game
4.) we all used branches to edit the file, then merged to main
5.) We used loops in various of places, for example in the puzzles.cc file, there was a loop inthe function to get all the variables in the function called inventory.
6.) We used functions in various of places, for example in main.cc there is a function named die() which is called when the user dies. 
7.) We used classes in different ways, for example in puzzles.h we declared a class called puzzles, the class that was eventually used to make the puzzles.cc which allowed us to call the puzzles for the user.
8.) We used a vector to create n inventory that the user eventually uses at the end to unlock the final gate
