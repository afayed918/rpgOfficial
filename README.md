RPG-40 Assignment From CSCI-40

1. Variables
ALmot every person's branch has made multiple variables fro their code like map size, bools, and number of hearts.

2. Algebra
One example of using algebra was that in the world.cc and combat.cc those people who worked on them used modular arithmetic when creating a random variable. World.cc also uses boundary checking which is an algebraic comparison.

3. Input and Output
In the combat.cc there is the fighting mechanic where if and when you interact with an aniaml, in this case a tiger, the screen outputs the number of hearts, and whatever action that follows that will output to the screen your remaining hearts.

4. Branches
Multiple segments of code include many if else branch statements regarding the movecursor function, the rand() function, and much more.

5. Loop
In main.cc, when inputting the user input for movement using WASD, that is all under a while true loop.

6. Functions
Almost every single person utilizes functions whether for boolean operators, map loading and saving, combat features, and more.
