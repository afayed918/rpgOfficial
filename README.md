RPG-40 Assignment From CSCI-40

Jacob Deel -> World Map Person
Moyinoluwa Oyinleye -> puzzle
Nickolai Davidian -> Dialogue and Music 
1.) we used variables in multiple places, for example in main.cc we used a string variables to store the users name
2.) we used algebra to randomize the map, so that the user gets an array of different maps
3.) we used input and output in multiple places, for example in main.cc we used collected the input of the user using a string variable to store the users name and then we ouputed said name with a welcome attached
4.) we all created our individual branches and editted in those branches before merging to main. For example, there is a branch called moyinO
5.) We used loops in various of places, for example in the puzzles.cc file, there was a loop inthe function to get all the variables in the function called inventory.
6.) We used functions in various of places, for example in main.cc there is a function named die() which is called when the user dies. 
7.) We used classes in different ways, for example in puzzles.h we declared a class called puzzles, the class that was eventually used to make the puzzles.cc which allowed us to call the puzzles for the user.
8.) For extra credit, we created an inventory using a vector<string>, in this vector we stored a bunch of letters that the user collected, after answering the puzzles correct;
- We incorporated a world map system by creating a file called world.cc that when called would print out the map. The file included functions that help create and generate the obstacles that the player will face as they interact with the game.
- We created a comat system by creatong a file called ombat.cc. In the file we randomized the  different ways in which the user can interact with the game and fight other animals in the jungle. Through this, the output is the user having a unique fighting experience each time
- through the code, we incorporate different uses of colors. The map layout is designed with multiple colors, the Treees are green, Water is blue, and the spaces are purple. All this incorporated creates a colorful array that helps the user have a nice experience
- We creted 7 unique puzzles, all created in the file puzzles.cc, and called in the file world.cc. The puzzles are all designed with the objective of the game, and connect to the overall theme of the game
- We have 40+ lines of dialogue, startign with the prologue which gives the overall objective of the game, then the story of how the player starts of. At the end we have dialogue connecting to theme of the game. The dialogue is dependent on the path the user takes.
